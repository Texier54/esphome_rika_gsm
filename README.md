# esphome_rika_gsm

The ```rika_gsm``` component emulate the gsm module that can be installed on rika stove. It provide a way to send command and retreive the sms the stove want to send.

## Hardaware

The GSM module share the same DA15 port as the ambiant temperature sensor at the back of the stove. The connection can be done by soldering new cables on sensor port or by creating a split cable to place in between.

Also the stove use 5v logic on the serial connection so some level shifting or protection could be required on your board.

## Config

### Component

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
        type: git
        url: https://github.com/n-serrette/esphome_rika_gsm
        ref: main
    components: [ rika_gsm ]

uart:
  id: rika_uart_bus
  tx_pin: GPIO16
  rx_pin: GPIO17
  baud_rate: 38400

rika_gsm:
  id: ria_gsm_component_1
  pin: "1234"
  phone_number: "+33685967412"
```

Configuartion variables:
* **pin** (string): 4 digit string corresponding to the pin code set in the gsm configuration of the stove.
* **id** (Optional, ID): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
* **phone_number** (Optional string): phone number use to communicate with the stove. No true sms are sent, this is a dummy phone number.

#### Note

Baud rate:
 * Revo (1st gen):  38400
 * TOPO: 38400 (not verified)
 * ROKO: 115200 (not verified)

### Text Sensor

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: rika_gsm
    raw_status:
      name: "Stove raw status"
```

Configuration variables

* **raw_status** (Optional): give the last sms that the stove sent
    * **name** (Required, string): The name for the raw_status text sensor.
    * **id** (Optional, ID): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
    * All other options from [Text Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/text_sensor/).


### Binary Sensor

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rika_gsm
    gsm_status:
      name: "GSM status"
```

Configuration variables

* **gsm_status** (Optional): indicate if the gsm option is set on the stove
    * **name** (Required, string): The name for the gsm_status binary sensor.
    * **id** (Optional, ID): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
    * All other options from [Binary Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/binary_sensor/).

When the gsm option is set the stove try to read if their is a new command every 5s. If their is no stove request after 10s the gsm option is considered deactivated and will be concidered active on the next stove request.

### rika_gsm.send_command Action

Send a command to the stove.

```yaml
on ...:
    then:
        - rika_gsm.send_command:
            command: "ON"
```

Configuration options:
 * **command** (Required, string, templatable): command sent to the stove
